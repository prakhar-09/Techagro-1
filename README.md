"Everything can wait but not Agriculture"

I, Prakhar Saxena, a first year student of B-Tech Computer Science at Lovely Professional University, here by propose an idea which could be a boom for INDIAN AGRICULTURE SECTOR and would not only provide employment to alot of rural people but would also increase their economic status of farmers and would make them self independent.  

*TECHAGRO - "Everything can wait, but not Agriculture."*    

Currently the techniques followed in agriculture are obsolete and of no use. We follow the same techniques that were followed by our ancestors 20-25 years ago. But the climate and weather conditions have changed drastically, pollution has increased on on uncountable scale that's why the net average production per hectare of India is also decreasing day by day.
Their are proven reports for example taking case of Ethiopia, where when appropriate amount of NPK was used and proper soil testing was done to grow maize , their net average production reached around 6-7 tons per hectare that is somewhere equal to the European average.
But in India it's not that easy or feasible to approach a small farmer to tell him to get his soil tested. As in India small farmers don't have 500-600 bucks, to buy seeds then why will he listen to us to get his soil tested. So making sure that it's within his reach will ensure that he would in fact listen to us but would also take the advice.

*Solution-*
Providing accessible, affordable and instant way of soil testing through RGB analysis and chromatography. The soil testing can be done in just few minutes at the rate of ₹13 per test.

*Advantages over existing technology-*
Conventional soil testing laboratories take around ₹50-₹600 to get the soil tested whereas through this device it would be done in just ₹13.

For conventional soil testing in laboratories it takes around 2weeks to even 2 months to get the soil tested as the sample is first sent to the laboratories which are mostly situated in the major cities and then after the test the farmer gets back the result. Whereas through this device it can be done instantly.

This device provides easy to understand reports which even the farmers can interpret without any difficulties making them self reliable. Whereas conventional soil testing provides detailed report which an illiterate (in terms of formal education) can't understand.

This device provides localized reports depending upon weather conditions and topographical data making the report more accurate. For Ex- The soil of UNNAO, a district in UP is quite rich in sulphur which is quite unnatural so it would cause errors in the conventional way of soil testing.

The device also provides weather precautions which could be of great help for farmers. If the farmers of Maharashtra would have got timely precautions about the pre mature rainfall then they would not have suffered such a big loss of onion crop and its price would have not hiked in India.

The device not only predicts the soil content but can also predict the most suitable crop along with type and amount of fertilizer required. It would also suggest precautions about weather conditions if any. The farmers have soil testing card which has details regarding the pincode and the area of their farm, so these data along with the NPK values helps in these predictions.

This project would not only affect the farmers but would also help in improving the economic status of India.
It mainly focuses on increasing the net average production of crop per hectare.

*Working -*
The farmers would just have to dip the given strip in the aqueous solution of their soil, stick it on the soil health card and scan it through the device. The soil health card would contain a barcode which would be unique for each farmer, having details like location, size and previous record
of tests (if any). All these details along with the stored dataset would help in predicting the most suitable crop, soil NPK content, along with type and amount of fertilizers required depending upon all of the aforesaid factors.
All the details would be printed on the soil health card in the local language.
This scanning device which cost around ₹400  could be installed in post offices of every village and in future it would be replaced by a smartphone application. Through the smartphone application, farmers could do the soil testing and prediction through just a click of their smartphones.
